# kollusion

kollusion is a project made by me (odyssey) in which I learn how to properly make an overlay.

currently, this project isn't much, but I have plans in the next coming months to get a working product for everyone.

# features

  - noflash
  - bhop
  - trigger w/delay
  - external overlayed visuals (TODO: make boxes "stick" to players more)
  
 # what's coming
  - aimbot w/ smoothing
  - radar
  - configs
  - have a fully featured SDK, not just stuff i'm in need of.
